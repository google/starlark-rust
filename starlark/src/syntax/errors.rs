//! Syntax error trait definition
//!
//! This module define the SyntaxError trait that all error that we pass around implements. It
//! identify all error by a unique code to identify easily an error even if changing the error
//! message.
//!
//! An error code is of the form AB00 where A is the error code level and B a module specific
//! prefix. 00 is the error number itself.
//!
//! # Error code levels:
//!
//!  * __C__ -> _Critical / Fatal_: stopped the parsing / evaluation
//!  * __E__ -> _Error_: was able to recover from the error but the state is incorrect. (e.g. a
//!  token was ignored during parsing). Prevent next phase from being run.
//!  * __W__ -> _Warning_: a warning for the user, this did not cause any error but are bad
//!  patterns that can lead to dubious behaviors.
//!  * __N__ -> _Notice_: notice of harmless improvement (e.g. dead code).
//!
//! # Modules prefix:
//!
//!  * __L__ -> Lexer
//!  * __P__ -> Parsing error
//!  * __S__ -> Syntaxic error
//!  * __E__ -> Evaluation
